This repository is part of a group project for Data Engineering Platforms. We developed a predictive model to identify the impact of various factors, such as region, airline, airport, and scheduled time, on the length of flight delays, and leveraged its insights to highlight practical ways to minimize duration of delays. We designed and created database tables and schema in SQL, and utilized Tableau to create interactive visualizations and dashboards to effectively communicate findings to stakeholders.
